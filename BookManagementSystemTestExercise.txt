📌 Task Overview
You will build a Book Management System where users can add, edit, view, and delete books, and each book can belong to multiple categories (many-to-many relationship).

🛠 Requirements
1️⃣ Backend - .NET Core API with Entity Framework Core
✅ Implement CRUD operations for Books and Categories.
✅ Establish a many-to-many relationship between Books and Categories using a junction table (BookCategory).
✅ Use DTOs & AutoMapper to transform database entities for the frontend.
✅ Use FluentValidation to validate API requests.
✅ Implement EF Core Migrations to create and update the database schema.

2️⃣ Frontend - React TypeScript
✅ Implement a Book Management Page:

Display a list of books with their associated categories.
Allow users to create, edit, and delete books.
✅ Implement a Category Management Page:
CRUD operations for categories.
Allow users to assign multiple categories to a book.
✅ Use Formik + Yup for form validation.
✅ Use React Router for navigation.
✅ Use Axios to call the API.
📌 API Endpoints
📌 BookController (/api/books)
🔹 GET /api/books → Fetch all books (including their categories).
🔹 GET /api/books/{id} → Fetch a specific book by ID.
🔹 POST /api/books → Add a new book with categories.
🔹 PUT /api/books/{id} → Update an existing book (including categories).
🔹 DELETE /api/books/{id} → Delete a book.

📌 CategoryController (/api/categories)
🔹 GET /api/categories → Fetch all categories.
🔹 POST /api/categories → Add a new category.
🔹 DELETE /api/categories/{id} → Delete a category.

📌 Bonus Features (Optional)
✅ Pagination & Search: Implement search functionality to filter books by category.
✅ Tag System: Display book categories as clickable tags.
✅ Advanced Validation: Prevent duplicate books/categories.
✅ Docker Support: Containerize the backend and frontend.
✅ Unit Testing:

Use xUnit and EF Core InMemory for API testing.
Use Jest + React Testing Library for frontend testing.
